Data preparation and possible scenarios...

## transcoding / normalizing sampling rates

- Find out the framerate (for reference) using the terminal
- If the video needs to be converted from the deviceâ€™s native format

Videos may require transcoding or cropping before analysis.
For example, the lines below ensure the correct frame rate is known prior to processing:

```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 \
-show_entries stream=r_frame_rate \
-of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 your-video.mp4
```

Simple editing tasks (e.g., trimming) can be performed with VLC or iMovie,
avoiding re-encoding artefacts.
